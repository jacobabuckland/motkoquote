# Motko — decision record

Standing decisions. Agents read this before any judgement call and write
resolved decisions back to it. Newest first.

It exists because the same questions were being asked repeatedly. #300 was
declared ambiguous three times by three PM runs; the third one recommended
exactly what had already been decided and blocked anyway, twenty minutes after
the ruling was posted on the issue. A decision that lives only in an issue
comment is a decision the next agent cannot find.

**A decision recorded here is binding.** An agent that finds its question
answered here acts on it and cites it — it does not re-open it, and it does not
ask for confirmation. An agent that believes a recorded decision is wrong
raises `CONTRACT CONFLICT` and reports it; it does not resolve the conflict
itself. The protocol these rules belong to is in `AGENTS.md`, under "Blocking
is the exception, not the fallback".

Entries are appended in the same commit as the work that acted on them, newest
first, in this shape:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <the question, one line>
Decision: <what was chosen>
Rationale: <why, two lines maximum>
Ticket: #NNN
Reversible: yes/no
Precedent: yes/no
```

`Reversible: no` means a revert does not undo it — a migration that has run, an
email that has been sent, a build that has been submitted. `Precedent: yes`
means later tickets will copy the pattern, so the cost of reversing it grows
with each one that does.

## Decisions

## 2026-08-21 — Does #306 implement auto-expand of a section on validation failure?
Decision: No. The spec's own "Explicitly out of scope" section excludes any
change to the behaviour of a Settings section, and auto-expanding on submit
failure requires PayoutDetailsSection to report its validation state to its
wrapper. The frozen contract has no test for it.
Rationale: The spec contradicts itself — derived criterion 6 asks for it and the
out-of-scope section forbids it — and the out-of-scope section is the one the
acceptance tests agree with. Wiring form validation to a wrapper is application
behaviour that wants a real form in front of it, not the primitive ticket.
Ticket: #306
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## 2026-08-21 — How does a roadmap card opt out of the factory explicitly?
Decision: A line reading `NOT FACTORY READY` or `FACTORY: no`, on its own line
in the card body. Admission stops the item, creates it, and leaves it unlabelled.
Rationale: The prose matchers only catch phrasings someone thought to write
down, so a card author needs one marker that always works rather than having to
guess which sentence the regex knows.
Ticket: #277 follow-up
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## 2026-08-21 — Which sort order does the active jobs list use?
Decision: Money-urgency tiers — overdue invoices, unpaid invoices, sent quotes,
sent contracts, drafts — oldest first within each tier, then job id as a final
tie-break. Tiers shown as labelled sections. The dashboard is unchanged.
Rationale: Outstanding money is what a contractor needs to see first, and age
within a tier is the only rule that is explainable without arguing value
against age. The job-id tie-break stops the list reshuffling between renders.
Ticket: #300
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## 2026-08-21 — Can the overdue tier be computed when an invoice has no due date?
Decision: Yes. A null `due_date` is not overdue and falls to the unpaid tier.
No new rule is needed.
Rationale: `invoices.due_date` is nullable, but `isInvoiceOverdue` in
`src/lib/job-stages.ts` already guards it and `deriveJobState` already emits the
`invoice_overdue` situation. This was a question about the schema, not a
product decision, and the schema answers it.
Ticket: #300
Reversible: yes
Precedent: no

## 2026-08-21 — Should #309 build against a mock disclosure while #306 is unmerged?
Decision: No. #309 waits for #306 to merge and resumes at `needs-spec` then.
Rationale: The spec says "using the disclosure component unmodified", so a
placeholder is built against an API that does not exist and replaced the moment
the real one lands — two Engineer rounds to reach the same place, and the
intermediate state cannot be reviewed against the contract that matters.
Ticket: #309
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## Seeded 2026-08-21 — decisions already taken before this record existed

These five predate the record. Each is stated as it stands today, with the
place in the tree that implements it, so a later agent can check the decision
against the code rather than against a memory of a conversation.

## Prior — Does the contract print bank details?
Decision: Only when the contractor cannot take a Stripe payment. When the rail
is available, `{{bank_details}}` resolves to empty and every `{{#bank_details}}`
section collapses.
Rationale: Under fee-at-source motko earns only when money moves through the
Stripe rail, and every template renders `{{bank_details}}` on a document the
customer keeps — a fee-free payment route leaked before the invoice exists.
Gated on capability (`canAcceptStripePayment`), not on account existence, so a
contractor mid-verification is still payable.
Where: `src/lib/contracts/build-variables.ts`
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## Prior — Does the active jobs list include drafts by default?
Decision: Yes. A job with no quote yet is a draft and belongs to the
`in_progress` bucket, which is the default view.
Rationale: A draft is unfinished work the contractor still owns; hiding it by
default makes the list disagree with what they think they have on.
Where: `src/lib/job-history.ts`
Ticket: #305
Reversible: yes
Precedent: no

## Prior — Is the contract clause wording settled?
Decision: Yes. The clause wording in the contract templates has been through
legal review and is signed off. Only the `{{variable}}` plumbing around a clause
may be edited; the clause text may not.
Rationale: The wording carries legal meaning that tests cannot check. This is on
the escalation list: a change to customer-facing contractual copy goes to a
human regardless of confidence.
Where: `src/lib/contracts/templates.ts`
Reversible: no
Precedent: yes

## Prior — Does the AASA file keep the `/i/*/paid` path?
Decision: Yes. `/i/*/paid` and `/settings` stay in the applinks paths for
`PLFZC3LK8F.app.motko.ios`.
Rationale: The paid confirmation is a deep link the app must own; removing it
sends a paying customer to the web page instead of the app.
Where: `public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association.json` and
`src/app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association/route.ts`
Reversible: yes
Precedent: no

## Prior — Is in-app notification control being built?
Decision: No. Notification control was dropped from scope.
Rationale: Not recorded in the tree at the time this record was seeded. Stated
here as given by the owner so the question is closed rather than re-asked; the
reasoning behind it should be filled in by whoever has it. The decision stands
either way — an agent meeting this question acts on it and does not re-open it.
Reversible: yes
Precedent: no

## 2026-08-21 — Does the voice question budget cover the three required slots?
Decision: No. MAX_SOW_TURNS now bounds discretionary scope/detail follow-ups
only; crew, pricing mode and materials supply sit outside it, as do the
customer details a quote cannot be sent without. A spent budget does not
excuse an unasked required slot — the agent asks it anyway.
Rationale: Five questions covering three mandatory asks plus scope plus
customer details is zero slack, so any upstream degradation surfaced as a
skipped mandatory question. A cap that can eat a required question is the wrong
shape at any value, so the exemption is the fix rather than a bigger number.
Ticket: V3
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## 2026-08-21 — Does the "infer rather than interrogate" instruction survive?
Decision: Qualified, not cut. The brevity licence is scoped explicitly to
discretionary detail and explicitly withheld from the three required slots.
Rationale: Cutting it makes the call feel like a form, which is what the line
was written to prevent; leaving it unqualified now pushes toward invention
rather than recall, since V1 removed the retrieved context it used to lean on.
Ticket: V3
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes

## 2026-08-21 — Do agent sessions get read-only DB access covering customer PII?
Decision: Yes, proceeding as specced. The owner was shown exactly what the
listed tables expose — jobs.transcript / conversation_json / sow_json carry
customer name, site address, phone and email; customers.name + customers.contact;
contracts.signer_name + signed_at — and chose to proceed rather than take the
redacted-view alternative.
Rationale: Transcript-vs-payload classification is the fastest diagnostic for
voice defects and was unavailable during the 21 Aug investigation, which
therefore reached a probabilistic answer where a definitive one existed.
Ticket: V4
Reversible: yes
Precedent: yes
